+ UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is another one of the major protocols that make up the internet protocol suite. UDP is less reliable than TCP, but is much simpler.

+ UDP is used for situations where some data loss is acceptable, like live video/audio, or where speed is a critical factor like online gaming.

+ While UDP is similar to TCP in that it's used to send and receive data online, there are a couple of key differences.

+ First, UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it does not establish a connection beforehand like TCP does with its three-way handshake.

+ Next, UDP doesn't guarantee that all data is successfully transferred. With UDP, data is sent to any device that happens to be listening, but it doesn't care if some of it is lost along the way. This is one of the reasons why UDP is also known as the "fire-and-forget" protocol.

+ A good way to think about these differences is that TCP is like a conversation between two people. Person A asks person B to talk. Person B says sure, that's fine. Person A agrees and they both start speaking.

+ UDP is more like a protester outside with a megaphone. Everyone who is paying attention to the protester should hear most of what they're saying. But there's no guarantee that everyone in the area will hear what the protester is saying, or that they're even listening.
