+ These types of the operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer technology and are being widely accepted all over the world and, that too, with a great pace. Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate with each other using a shared communication network. 

+ Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred to as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. These systemâ€™s processors differ in size and function. 

+ The major benefit of working with these types of the operating system is that it is always possible that one user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but some other system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network.

### Advantages of Distributed Operating System:

+ Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent from each other.
+ Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed.
+ Since resources are being shared, computation is highly fast and durable.
+ Load on host computer reduces.
+ These systems are easily scalable as many systems can be easily added to the network.
+ Delay in data processing reduces.

### Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System:

+ Failure of the main network will stop the entire communication.
+ To establish distributed systems the language which is used are not well defined yet.
+ These types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive. Not only that the underlying software is highly complex and not understood well yet.

#### Examples of Distributed Operating System are - **LOCUS, etc.**
