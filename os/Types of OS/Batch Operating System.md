+ This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them into batches. It is the responsibility of the operator to sort jobs with similar needs.

### Advantages of Batch Operating System:

+ It is very difficult to guess or know the time required for any job to complete. Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in queue
+ Multiple users can share the batch systems
+ The idle time for the batch system is very less
+ It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems

### Disadvantages of Batch Operating System:

+ The computer operators should be well known with batch systems
+ Batch systems are hard to debug
+ It is sometimes costly
+ The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails

#### Examples of Batch based Operating System: **Payroll System, Bank Statements, etc.**
