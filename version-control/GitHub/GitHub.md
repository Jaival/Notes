GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine working on a project at home and while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution to a code error that has kept you restless for days.

You cannot make these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with a command on whatever computer you have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.

In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform. Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to collaborate with other developers from any location.


## How to push a repository to GitHub

#### Step 1 – Create a GitHub account
+ To be able to use GitHub, you will have to create an account first. You can do that on their [website](https://github.com/).

#### Step 2 – Create a repository
+ You can click on the `+` symbol on the top right corner of the page then choose "New repository". Give your repo a name then scroll down and click on "Create repository".

#### Step 3 – Add and commit file(s)
+ Before we "add" and "commit" our files, you need to understand the stages of a file being tracked by Git.

##### Committed state
+ A file is in the **committed** state when all the changes made to the file have been saved in the local repo. Files in the committed stage are files ready to be pushed to the remote repo (on GitHub).

##### Modified state
+ A file in the **modified** state has some changes made to it but it's not yet saved. This means that the state of the file has been altered from its previous state in the committed state.

##### Staged state
+ A file in the **staged** state means it is ready to be committed. In this state, all necessary changes have been made so the next step is to move the file to the commit state.
